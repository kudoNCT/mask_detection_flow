## Update

* 2019.04: Release pytorch-version DSFD inference code.
* 2019.03: DSFD is accepted by CVPR2019.
* 2018.10: Our DSFD ranks No.1 on [WIDER FACE](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/WIDERFace/WiderFace_Results.html) and [FDDB](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/results.html)


## Introduction
<p align='center'>
  <img src='./imgs/dsfd_video.gif' width=1000'/>
</p>

In this repo, we propose a novel face detection network, named DSFD, with superior performance over the state-of-the-art face detectors. You can use the code to evaluate our DSFD for face detection. 

For more details, please refer to our paper [DSFD: Dual Shot Face Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10220)! or poster [slide](./imgs/DSFD_CVPR2019_poster.pdf)!

Our DSFD face detector achieves state-of-the-art performance on [WIDER FACE](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/WIDERFace/WiderFace_Results.html) and [FDDB](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/results.html) benchmark.

|  Backbone  | Easy  | Medium | Hard  | E2E latency (s) |                           Download                           |

| ResNet-152 | 0.967 | 0.952  | 0.905 | 6.26            | [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pytorch/models/resnet152-b121ed2d.pth) |

**Easy**, **Medium** and **Hard** denote AP on WIDER FACE validation set Easy, Medium and Hard, respectively.

**E2E latency** denotes an end-to-end latency (= preprocess + network + TTA + postprocess).

Latency is measured with batch size **1** on **RTX 2080Ti GPU** and **Threadripper 2950X CPU**.

Confidence thresholds were set to **0.01** for both AP and latency benchmark.
